## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was collected from internal sales records of Techno Data for FY 2023-24.
It includes information on product categories, sales quantities, costs, brand-wise expenditures, regional distribution, and supervisor performance. The data is intended for internal business analysis and performance tracking.

## Features / Highlights
Business Problem
Sales and business teams lacked a centralized, visual platform to monitor product-wise performance, regional coverage, and brand-level costs, making it challenging to identify key profit drivers and optimize inventory.

## Goal of the Dashboard
To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that clearly communicates overall and detailed sales performance, highlights top-performing categories and brands, and supports data-driven decision-making for better profitability.

## Key Analysis Walkthrough
The dashboard provides insights into:
Count of sales by product category (e.g., Monitor, CPU, Mouse).
Total cost breakdown by brand (e.g., Intel, Samsung, Nvidia).
Geographic sales distribution across Indian states.
Key financial KPIs including Total Cost, Quantity, Total Sales, and Profit.
Supervisor overview to track team contributions.

## Business Impact
Empowers leadership to quickly identify high-profit categories and brands, allocate resources effectively, optimize cost structures, and strategize region-wise marketing efforts, ultimately driving higher profitability and operational efficiency.
